## <div align="center"> The Ultimate Anonymous Shit-Dumping Platform 🚀 </div>

BinaryShit is an anonymous platform designed for our class to **rant, share memories, and post anything freely**. Built **overnight**, it quickly became a hotspot for raw, unfiltered thoughts. However, with great anonymity comes great chaos—we faced **NoSQL injection, object injection, DDoS, and XSS attacks** on launch night. But after pulling an all-nighter securing the server, BinaryShit stood strong and remains **fully functional and attack-resistant**. We’re now working on **new updates** to make it even more interactive—maybe even for a wider audience!

## 🚀 Features

- **Anonymous Posting**: Share thoughts and memories without revealing identity.
- **Secure & Resilient**: Patched against NoSQL Injection, DDoS, and XSS attacks.
- **Fast & Simple UI**: A seamless experience, thanks to **Aditya**.
- **Built for Fun**: A place to dump thoughts, make memories, and laugh.
- **Upcoming Updates**: More interactions for the class—and maybe beyond!

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm
- MongoDB
- A deployment platform (Vercel recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```

   ```
   cd BinaryShit
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables (`.env` file):
   for server:
   ```
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   RECAPTCHA_SECRET = recaptcha_secret_key
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS = "http://localhost:5173"
   ```
   for client:
   ```
   VITE_BASE_API_URL ="http://127.0.0.1:8080"
   VITE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:5173"
   VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITEKEY = recaptcha_site_key
   ```

5. Start the servers:
   for server-side
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   for client-side
   ```
   npm dev
   ```

7. Access the platform locally:

   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## 🛡 Security Enhancements

- **NoSQL Injection Protection**: Sanitized queries & input validation.
- **DDoS Mitigation**: Rate limiting & IP blocking.
- **XSS Prevention**: Content sanitization & secure headers.
- **Object Injection Protection**: Controlled data access & validation.

Big thanks to **Rahul Marban** for helping me understand **server security with Vercel**.
